### Patch Changes

- ba7f3cc: Refactors the entire repository to break out out of the original buttery tools. This PR consolidates all of the disparate functions into a singular `ButteryTokens` class that is then used to expose an API to create and develop tokens. In addition, this API is used in a CLI created with `fizmoo`.
